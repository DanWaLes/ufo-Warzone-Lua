This mod allows players to purchase a special unit called a Capitalist. When a Capitalist unit is killed from an attack (only when it is attacked by another player!), it will take away a percentage of income from the killer for the next turn.

This mod requires using the commerce gamemode. To purchase a Capitalist unit, visit the commerce build menu and pay its cost.  By default, you can only have three Capitalist's at any given time.
