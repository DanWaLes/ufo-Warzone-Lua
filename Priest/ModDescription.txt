This mod allows players to purchase a priests.  When a priest is in an army unit, whatever damage the armies do will instead convert the killed armies to their own side. Settings for priest damage is there but I recommend that it is left on 1.

This mod requires using commerce mode.  To purchase a priest, visit the commerce build menu and pay its cost.  By default, you can only have three priests at one time.
